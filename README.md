# Predictive-Model-for-Enrollment-Increase-based-on-Income-Analysis

This repository contains the code and data for performing income prediction analysis based on various factors using the United States Census Bureau's Adult Income Dataset. The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model/application that can forecast an individual's income and use it to tailor marketing efforts to attract potential students for UVW College.
Introduction

The marketing team at UVW College aims to increase enrollment by creating a predictive model/application that can forecast an individual's income based on demographic and employment factors. This readme provides an overview of the project goals, data visualization scenarios, and the code file included in this repository.
Goals

The main goals of this project are as follows:

   Perform comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the data and identify relevant patterns or trends.
   Extract important features that contribute to accurate income classification and provide insights into demographic and employment factors associated with income levels.
   Develop a classification model that accurately predicts whether an individual's income exceeds $50K based on the provided dataset.
   Evaluate the performance of the classification algorithm and make fine adjustments for optimal performance.

Data Visualization Scenarios

The following scenarios showcase different data visualizations created to gain insights into the dataset and understand the relationship between various factors and income levels:

   Correlation Heatmap: Visualizing the relationship between dataset attributes using a heatmap to identify relevant features for the classification model.
   Age Distribution by Occupation: Analyzing the age distribution for individuals of different occupations in both low- and high-income demographics using boxplots.
   Education Level and Income: Examining the effect of education levels on income by plotting a stacked bar chart to compare the proportion of people in each education level earning above and below $50K.
   Gender and Work Class: Studying the gender-wise split of high- and low-income individuals in different work classes using countplots.
   Gender and Education: Investigating the gender-wise split of high- and low-income individuals for different education levels using countplots.
   Age and Hours Worked: Analyzing the relationship between age and hours worked for individuals in different income brackets using a line chart.
   Gender and Age: Visualizing the gender-wise income distribution for different age ranges of individuals using a clustered bar chart and a line chart.
   Clustered Heatmap: Identifying similarities among groups of individuals based on age, gender, and income level using a clustered heatmap.

Please refer to the code file for detailed implementation and usage instructions.
